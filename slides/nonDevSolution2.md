### Middleman on a server

GitHub deploys can trigger a build

Note:
On GitHub, set up a WebHook URL pointing to an [app on Heroku](https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher). That app can run a build and deploy to a second app on Heroku. Content can be edited in GitHub's web editor or with the super slick [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) app so content editor's don't need to use git.
